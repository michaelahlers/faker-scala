========================================================================


Overview of the program "gender"


The program "gender.c" is a program for determining the gender of a given
fist nane.

List of files:

a)  gen_ext.h     (contains macros and prototypes; may be changed)
b)  umlaut_g.h    (contains lists of umlauts)
c)  gender.c      (this is the "workhorse" of the program)
d)  nam_dict.txt  (dictionary file containing 42000+ first names)

The file "nam_dict.txt", which contains a list of first names, uses the
char set "iso8859-1".

If you want to use "gender.c" as a library, delete the line
"#define GENDER_EXECUTABLE"  from the file "gen_ext.h".

Notice:
The exe file included in this download is a DOS exe, so you have to obey
the rules for 8.3 filenames under DOS.


========================================================================


The dictionary file "nam_dict.txt"


The program "gender.c" uses the dictionary file "nam_dict.txt" as a data 
source. This file contains a list of more than 42,000 first names and 
gender, plus some 700 pairs of "equivalent" names.
This list should be able to cover the vast majority of first names 
in all European contries and in some overseas countries (e.g. China, 
India, Japan, U.S.A.) as well.

Also included in this file is information on the approximate frequency 
of each name. The scale goes from 1 (=rare) to 13 (=extremely common).
The value 10 has been formatted to represent at least 2 percent of 
the population. (The values 11 to 13 have been added last.)
The scale is logarithmic. For countries with very good statistics, 
each step (down to frequency 2) represents a factor of 2. 
For example, a frequency value of 7 means that the correspondig first 
name has an absolute in the range of 0.25 % to 0.5 %.

The sorting order of the file "nam_dict.txt" is governed by the search 
algorithm of the program "gender.c". Hence, names with "expandable" 
umlauts can be found twice in this dictionary, first with sorting 
according to "expanded" umlauts, and second with sorting according to 
"compressed" umlauts (e.g. 'Ö' is sorted like "Oe" and 'O').

You don't have to reformat this file for use in a unix environment, 
because the DOS linefeeds (trailing '\r') are ignored when the file
is read.


========================================================================


A few words on quality of data


The dictionary of first names has been prepared with utmost care.

For example, the Turkish, Indian and Korean names in this dictionary 
have all been independently lassified by several native speakers.
I also took special care to list only those names which can currently 
be found.

The lesson from this?
Any modifications should be done very cautiously (and they must also 
adhere to the sorting required by the search algorithm).

For example, knowing that "Sascha" is a boy's name in Germany, the author 
never assumed the English "Sasha" to be a girl's name. 
Knowing that "Jan" is a boy's name in Germany, I never assumed it to be 
also a English short form of "Janet". Another case in point is the name 
"Esra". This is a boy's name in Germany, but a girl's name in Turkey.

Or consider the following first names:

Ildikó     female Hungarian name
Mitja      male Russian name
Elizaveta  rare name; looks like misspelled "Elizabeta"
Roelf      rare name; looks like German "Rolf" with an erroneous 'e'

Borchert, Oltmann, Sievert, Hartmann    look like common German surnames


========================================================================


The function "get_gender"


The function "get_gender" is used to check first names and determine their
gender. This function has the following return values, which are defined
in the file "gen_ext.h":

IS_FEMALE         :  female first name
IS_MOSTLY_FEMALE  :  mostly female (= unisex name, which is mostly female)
IS_MALE           :  male first name
IS_MOSTLY_MALE    :  mostly male (= unisex name, which is mostly male)
UNISEX_NAME       :  unisex name (can be male or female)

NAME_NOT_FOUND    :  name not found
ERROR_IN_NAME     :  name contains an error
ERROR_IN_DATAFILE :  error in dictionary file "nam_dict.txt"

In the case of a "multiple" first name (e.g. "Carl J.D."), "get_gender" 
checks every single name and combines the results. For example, the name 
"A. Paul" is marked as male, because "A." can be any gender and "Paul" 
is a boy's name. 

An exception are some names like (e.g.) "Jean-Claude". This name is 
directly labeled as "IS_MALE", because there is a corresponding entry 
in the dictionary file.


========================================================================


The function "check_nickname"


The function "check_nickname" is used to check whether two first names 
are "equivalent" (e.g. "Bill" and "William"). 
This function has the following return values, which are defined in the 
file "gen_ext.h":

EQUIVALENT_NAMES  :  names are equivalent
NOT_EQUAL_NAMES   :  names are not equivalent

ERROR_IN_NAME     :  name contains an error
ERROR_IN_DATAFILE :  error in dictionary file "nam_dict.txt"


========================================================================


The function "find_similar_name" (new in version 1.2)


The dictionary of first names covers a vast range of names. 

Experience has shown that, for Germany at least, any names NOT found 
in the dictionary are mostly misspellings or typographical errors, 
e.g. "Konschieta" instead of "Conchita" or "Joesph" instead of "Joseph".

To get help in these cases, the function "find_similar_name" has been 
added to the program:

   int find_similar_name (char first_name[], int country,
           char result_string[], int len);

This function evaluates three factors to arrive at the most likely 
corrections:
- Extended Levenshtein function with "true" rule-based phonetics
  (for German)
  (from the program "addr" by the same author; see references).
- Frequency of name, plus weight of country.

All figures are weighed up to give a logarithmic measure of the likelihood 
of a given correction.


a)
"Normal" use of the function

The function returns the number of matches and a result string which 
contains a list of names. If more than one name is found, they are 
separated by "; " (semicolon plus space), with the most likely name coming 
first. 

Negative return values indicate an error (e.g. result string is too short).


b)
"Expanding" abbreviations (e.g. "Chr.")

Secondly, it is also possible to use an abbreviation (e.g. "Chr.") as a 
search string. The function will then try to "expand" the search name 
and return a list of matches mainly sorted by frequency, which is a measure 
of the probability of a given name. At most 20 matches will be returned.

Since the function is likely to return more than one or two matches, the 
result string must be long enough. Otherwise the list will be truncated.

You should also be aware that the function allows for "compressed umlauts".
For example, a search for "Ulk." (with '.') will give the matches "Ülker" 
and "Ülkü".


c)
Quality of the results: two caveats

This function is pretty good, but of course not perfect.
Any names returned by this function should be seen as suggestions 
rather than valid corrections.

For example, for the name "Soonja", which is a valid Korean name 
(albeit mostly written as "Soon Ja" or "Soon-Ja"), the first entry 
in the list of matches will be "Sonja", which is much more common.

Therefore, is too "dangerous" to apply corrections automatically.

Secondly:
As noted above, the phonetic rules used in this program are based on 
the German language. 
Therefore, they might not work very well for English and French names.


d)
Speed of the function

With todays computers, the running time should in most cases be in the 
order of about one millisecond or less.


========================================================================


"Standardizing" first names  (new in version 1.2)


Another useful application for the function "find_similar_name" is 
in generating standardized spellings for first names. 

a)
"Standardizing" Arabic first names

Arabic names often have a lot of "synonyms". These synonyms arise 
because the Arabic "alphabet" does NOT record the vowels. 
Only the consonants are written down.

Hence, a search for "Muhamed" will give you the following list:
Mohamed, Mohammad, Mohammed, Mohamad, Muhammad, Muhamed, Muhammed

To get a "standardized spelling", you simply do a normal function call 
and use only the first entry from the list of names.


b)
"Standardizing" Russian first names

Name from Belarus and Ukraine often differ from their Russian "equivalent".
In many cases, these names do not even look similar:

Russland                 Ukraine        Belarus
-----------------------------------------------------------
Aleksandr, Alexander     Oleksandr      Aliaksandr
Nikolai, Nikolay         Mykola         Mikalaj
Oleg                     Oleh           Aleh
Sergei, Sergey           Serhij         Siarhei, Siarhej
Tatiana, Tatyana         Tetyana        Tatsiana
Vladimir, Wladimir       Volodymyr      Uladzimir  ("U" !!)

As with Arabic first names, to get a "standardized spelling", you simply 
do a normal function call and use only the first entry from the list of 
names.


c)
Converting first names to utf8 or unicode

If you are planning to convert a gicen database from ASCII to utf8 or unicode, 
you might also want to convert first names to their "native" spelling.

The "original" function "find_similar_name" will simply return an ASCII string 
and cannot be used for this purpose.

However, the function "find_similar_name_utf8" or "find_similar_name_unicode", 
respectively, can do the job. 

Do the following:
1. Use "get_gender" to check if first name is in the dictionary of first names.
2. If it is, feed this name to "find_similar_name_utf8" or 
   "find_similar_name_unicode", respectively.
3. If the list of matches contains exactly one entry, you are done.

Examples:
Try the names "Ayse", "Danute" or "Sasa".


========================================================================


Other functions


Cleanup function

Upon starting the program, the dictionary file "nam_dict.txt" is statically 
opened to speed up data access.

The down side is that you have to close this file when you finally exit 
the program. Call the function "cleanup_gender()" for this task.



Use a file as input for "gender.c"

If you want to use gender.c in a "batch" job to determine the gender of
all names in a given file, use a separate line for each name and call:
   gender -get_gender -file  <file>  [-detail]
The suboption "-detail" will print detailed information on the frequency
of each names in the various countries.



Consistency check

Call the program "gender" with argument "-check_consistency" to do a 
consistency check. There should be no inconsistencies, of course.



Print all names of a given country

Call:   gender -print_names_of_country  <country>  [ -unicode_file=<file>" ]
Calling:  gender -print_names_of_country  all  [ -unicode_file=<file>" ]
will do printing for all countries.

The optional suboption "-unicode_file=<file>" generates a native unicode 
file, so you don't have to reformat any internal "replacement-chars" 
(array "umlauts_unicode[]") for non-iso8859-1 umlauts.



Print statistics

Call the program "gender" with argument "-statistics" or "-statistics -full"
to get elementary or full statistics, respectively. 
Printing full statistics may take a while...


========================================================================


Interfaces for unicode support (new in version 1.2)


The following functions are available for unicode data:

1.  int get_gender_unicode
           (char first_name[], int compare_mode, int country);

2.  int check_nickname_unicode (char first_name_1[], 
           char first_name_2[], int compare_mode, int country);

3.  int find_similar_name_unicode (char first_name[], int country,
           char result_string[], int two_byte_len);

These functions work in the same way as the "normal" functions 
"get_gender", "check_nickname" and "find_similar_name".

A caveat:
You must be aware that unicode support ist restricted to Latin alphabets. 
See the chapter "unicode chars" for a list of supported chars.


========================================================================


Interfaces for utf-8 support (new in version 1.2)


The following functions are available for utf-8 data:

1.  int get_gender_utf8
           (char first_name[], int compare_mode, int country);

2.  int check_nickname_utf8 (char first_name_1[], 
           char first_name_2[], int compare_mode, int country);

3.  int find_similar_name_utf8 (char first_name[], int country,
           char result_string[], int one_byte_len);

These functions work in the same way as the "normal" functions 
"get_gender", "check_nickname" and "find_similar_name".

A caveat:
You must be aware that utf8 support ist restricted to Latin alphabets. 
See the chapter "unicode chars" for a list of supported chars.


========================================================================


Unicode chars


Internally, this program uses the char set "iso8859-1".
"Non-iso" unicode chars are represented as follows:
   256 = <A/>
   257 = <a/>
   258 = <Â>
   259 = <â>
   260 = <A,>
   261 = <a,>
   262 = <C´>
   263 = <c´>
   268 = <C^> or <CH>
   269 = <c^> or <ch>

   279 = <e°>
   280 = <E,>
   281 = <e,>
   282 = <Ê>
   283 = <ê>
   286 = <G^>
   287 = <g^>
   290 = <G,>
   291 = <g´>

   311 = <k,>
   315 = <L,>
   316 = <l,>
   317 = <L´>
   318 = <l´>
   321 = <L/>
   322 = <l/>
   325 = <N,>
   326 = <n,>
   327 = <N^>
   328 = <n^>
   336 = <Ö>
   337 = <ö>
   338 =  or <OE>
   339 =  or <oe>
   344 = <R^>
   345 = <r^>
   350 = <S,>
   351 = <s,>
   352 =  or <S^> or <SCH> or <SH>
   353 =  or <s^> or <sch> or <sh>
   354 = <T,>
   355 = <t,>
   357 = <t´>
   362 = <U/>
   363 = <u/>
   366 = <U°>
   367 = <u°>
   370 = <U,>
   371 = <u,>
   379 = <Z°>
   380 = <z°>
   381 = <Z^>
   382 = <z^>
  7838 = <ß>    /***  newly defined "Großes ß"  ***/

A plus char ('+') "inside" a name symbolizes a '-', ' ' or an empty string
(this option applies to Chinese and Korean names only).
Thus, "Jun+Wei" represents the names "Jun-Wei", "Jun Wei" and "Junwei".

Frequently Asked Questions


a)
Is it possible to use this program in a commercial software project?

This is exactly what the Library GPL has been designed for.
See the file "LIB_GPLG.TXT" for details.

Probably the "safest" way to comply with the rules of the LGPL is
to put the program in a separate library (e.g. Windows-DLL).
In this way, only this library is subject to the LGPL and the "rest"
of the project still has the "old" rights of its owner, so you don't
have to give away your source code.


b)
Is a Java version of this program available?

The company which has written a Java version of my program "phonet"
has also promised to develop a native Java version of "gender" under
the LGPL - see:  https://opensource.softmethod.de/trac/opensource
The project name will be "gender4j".

Alternatively, you can also write a wrapper class in Java which uses 
the Java Native Interface to call a C library.
There is an excellent article (in German) telling you how to do it:
"Kaffee mit Vitamin C", c't, issue 20/2000, pp.242-247
or:  www.heise.de/ct, soft-link 0020242. 


c)
Is a PHP version of this programm available?

As of September 2008, Anatoliy Belsky ("anatoliy@belsky.info") 
is doing just that. Currently, the project is available from:
  http://gender.rubay.de .
He thinks it is likely that the project will finally be included in:
  http://pecl.php.net .

The PHP version will have the same name as the original program
(i.e. "gender"). Both the PHP version and the database of first names
included in the project will be subject to the PHP licence.


d)
Can I get a graphical user interface for this program?

Thanks to the efforts of Eike "Zed" Schmidt ("Zed_Gecko@gmx.de"), 
a simple graphical user interface for "gender" is now available.
See:  www.autohotkey.net/~Zed_Gecko/gender/WinGender.zip


e)
What is the speed of this program?

Due to the coherent use of binary search algorithms, this program runs 
very fast even on an old computer.

In order to get measurable running times, you have to do tens or even 
hundreds of thousands of function calls.


========================================================================


What about Wikipedia / Wiktionary ?


In 2009, the author plans to make his dictionary of first names available 
in Wikipedia or Wiktionary.

The dictionary of first names (file "nam_dict.txt") is subject to the 
GNU Free Documentation License. Therefore, anybody can use this file to 
e.g. create national lists of first names in Wiktionary. 

As you can see in a comment on
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Italian_given_names
it might be more appropriate to add any lists of first names to Wiktionary
rather than to Wikipedia.

If you want to do it yourself, call  
"gender -print_names_of_country  <country>  -unicode_file=<file>"
for this purpose. The suboption "-unicode_file=<file>" generates a native 
unicode file, so you don't have to reformat any internal "replacement-chars" 
(array "umlauts_unicode[]") for non-iso8859-1 umlauts.

Of course, you also have to give proper credit to author and data source.
The data source should at least be identified by:
    Source:
    File "nam_dict.txt" from www.heise.de/ct, soft-link 0717182
    (c) by Jörg MICHAEL, Hannover, Germany, 2007-2008
(To avoid typos, it is best to copy and paste these lines.)

Some additional remarks:

a)
There is not a unique well-defined rule for transcriptions from cyrillic 
alphabets. Many cyrillic names have more than one valid transcription,
and the transcription rules also vary from country to country.

For example, the following names refer to the same "original" cyrillic 
name:
 - Aleksander, Aleksandr, Alexander, Alexandr, (and sometimes even Oleksandr)
 - Maria, Marija and Mariya
 - Tatiana, Tatjana and Tatyana
 - Vladimir and Wladimir

Since this dictionary emphasizes the true frequency of a name, 
I strived to give all valid "normal" transcriptions equal or at least 
similar frequency values.

Hence, if you prepare names lists for Russia, Belarus, Ukraine or 
Bulgaria, you have to familarize yourself with the subleties of the 
various cyrillic alphabets.

b)
Last but not least, Chinese and Korean names (and also some of Arabic names)
need special formatting.
For all these countries, I have used a plus char ('+') "inside" a name 
to symbolize '-', ' ' or an empty string. Thus, "Jun+Wei" represents the 
names "Jun-Wei", "Jun Wei" and "Junwei".

In practice however, most Chinese first names appear as a "single" name,
while Korean first names are mostly written as separate names.
Therefore, the Chinese name "Xiao+Wei" should be formatted as "Xiaowei",
while the Korean name "Kyung+Hee" should be formatted as "Kyung Hee".
